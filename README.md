## Description

This is a flutter package that wraps the native [iOS](https://github.com/spotify/ios-sdk) and [Android](https://github.com/spotify/android-sdk) Spotify "remote" SDKs as well as the [Spotify Web Playback SDK](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-playback-sdk/) for web.

## Installation

To use this plugin, add `spotify_sdk` as a [dependency in your pubspec.yaml file](https://flutter.io/using-packages/).

## Setup

### Android

This package is using both the spotify-app-remote sdk and spotify-auth library. The auth library is needed to get the authentication token to work with the web api.

From the [Spotify Android SDK Quick Start](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/android/quick-start/). You need two things:

1. Register your app in the [spotify developer portal](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/). You also need to create a sha-1 fingerprint and add this and your package name to the app settings on the dashboard as well as a redirect url.
2. download the current [Spotify Android SDK](https://github.com/spotify/android-sdk/releases). Here you need the spotify-app-remote-*.aar and spotify-auth-*.aar.

After you are all setup you need to add the *.aar files to your Android Project as Modules. See the [Spotify Android SDK Quick Start](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/android/quick-start/) for detailed information.

Important here is the naming so that the package can find the modules.

- Remote: spotify-app-remote
- Auth: spotify-auth

### iOS

Register your app in the [spotify developer portal](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/). You also need to register your Bundle ID as well as a Redirect URI.

Follow the instructions in the section `Setup the iOS SDK` of [Spotify iOS SDK Quick Start](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/ios/quick-start/).

### Web

1. Register your app in the [spotify developer portal](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/). You need to provide a redirect URL which points to a dedicated page on a website you own.

2. Paste the following onto the webpage, which you linked to in your redirect URL.  
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Authenticating Spotify</title>
  </head>
  <body>
	<p>Please wait while we authenticate Spotify...</p>
	<script type="text/javascript">
		if(window.opener) {
			window.opener.postMessage('?' + window.location.href.split('?')[1], "*");
		} else {
			window.close();
		}
	</script>
  </body>
</html>
```

[You need Spotify Premium to access the Web SDK.](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-playback-sdk/quick-start/)

## Usage

To start using this package you first have to connect to Spotify. To only connect you can do this with connectToSpotifyRemote(...) or getAuthenticationToken(...) in both of these methods you need the client id, given in the spotify dashboard and the redirect url you set in the settings on the dashboard.

```dart
  await SpotifySdk.connectToSpotifyRemote(clientId: "", redirectUrl: "")
```

If you want to use the web api as well you have to use this method to get the authentication token. 
You can specify multiple scopes by separating them with a comma "," as shown below. For more information on scopes you can refer to [Spotify Authorization Scopes Guide](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/scopes/)

```dart
  var authenticationToken = await SpotifySdk.getAuthenticationToken(clientId: "", redirectUrl: "", scope: "app-remote-control,user-modify-playback-state,playlist-read-private");
```

On iOS you can store the token that you get from `getAuthenticationToken(...)` and then pass it to `connectToSpotifyRemote(...)` during the next session. This will avoid having to switch to the Spotify app for establishing the connection. This library does not handle storing the token. It is up to you to persist it wherever you see fit. Keep in mind that this feature is currently quite buggy in the native iOS SDK and has many side effects like random disconnections. Proceed with caution.

On iOS Spotify starts playing music when attempting connection. This is a default behavior and there is no official way to prevent this with the currently supported authentication flows. You have the option to pass a Spotify URI upon connection or set it to a blank string to play the last played song. There is an undocumented workaround if you don't want music to start playing which is to pass an invalid Spotify URI instead. This is not officially supported by the Spotify SDK or this library and it can fail or stop working at any time!

Have a look [in the example](example/lib/main.dart) for detailed insights on how you can use this package.
